This repo includes all open source content for the Nebraska GenCyber camp. Files in this repository are intended to provide step-by-step self paced tutorials to students seeking to learn about cybersecurity first principles as part of the UNO Gencyber camp. The strategy is to *learn by doing*. The 2019 camp theme is `Rube Goldberg Machines`.

# Code of Conduct
By participating in this camp, you choose to abide by this Code of Conduct.

## Applicability
This code of conduct serves to ensure that everybody and anybody who wishes to participate in camp activities is able to do so. Further, it applies to online activities related to the Camp, including postings on GitHub, Slack, and other online sites.

## Principles
**Do Not Harass**
Harassment is any unwelcome or hostile behavior towards another person for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussion or events, nonconsensual publication of private comments, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Conduct need not be intentional to be harassment.

## Respect the Opinions and Abilities of Others
The Camp is a place for people all of different skill levels and approaches to meet and work together toward common goals. As a result, we do not expect that everybody will share the same opinion. However, we do expect that disagreement is done respectfully.

Additionally, we expect that members will educate others respectfully. To this end, do not assume anybody else’s level of expertise or knowledge. Do not belittle a lack of information, or insist on unnecessary precision. We are all learning, so afford others—as well as yourself—room to grow.

## Keep Your Team Open
Except for instances where it would significantly impede productivity, there is always room on a project/activity for one more person. Unless doing so would be counter-productive to the goals of the project, anybody who is interested in a project/activity is allowed to join it.

## Aspirations
While this document exists primarily to prevent certain bad behavior, we also believe that our camp community members should work towards a higher standard. To that end, we strongly encourage the following conduct, though they are considered aspirational rather than necessary.

## Build With, Not For
Work to ensure that the camp community is well-represented in all stages of development. Seek out those who are under-represented, and remove barriers to access. Listen as much—or more—than you speak, and give full consideration to all ideas, even if they seem improbable at first.

## Empower, Experiment, and Find a Way for Everybody to Contribute
When more people share their knowledge and skills, they give a project/activity a greater chance to succeed. When somebody shows up with an unusual skill, look for ways to fit them into the team rather than reasons why it wouldn’t work. Experiment with new approaches, and don’t be afraid to try something that might not work.
