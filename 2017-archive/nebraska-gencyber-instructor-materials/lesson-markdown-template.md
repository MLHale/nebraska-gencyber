### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson
 (delete this line and all bullets that do not apply )

* __Abstraction__: An abstraction is a representation of an object or concept. It could be something such as a door, a speedometer, or a data structure in computer science. Abstraction decouples the design from the implementation. The gauges in an automobile are an abstraction of the performance of a car. A map is an abstraction of the earth.

* __Domain Separation__: Good fences make good neighbors. When trying to secure a home or computer, separating the areas where resources are and people work prevents accidents and loss of data or private information. We are preventing the information worlds from colliding.

* __Data Hiding__: Data hiding is the technique that does not allow certain aspects of an object to be observed or accessed. Data and information hiding keeps the programmer from having complete access to data structures. It allows access to only what is necessary.

* __Layering__: Cyber security uses multiple layers of defense or protecting information. If one layer is defeated the next layer should catch it.

* __Least Privilege__: One of the ways to protect information is by limiting what people can see and do with your information and resources. The principle of least privilege says to allow the minimum number of privileges necessary to accomplish the task.

* __Minimization__: Minimization refers to having the least functionality necessary in a program or device. The goal of minimization is to simplify and decrease the number of ways that software can be exploited. This can include **turning off ports that are not needed**, reducing the amount of code running on a machine, and/or turning off unneeded features in an application.

* __Modularization__: The concept of modularity is like building blocks. Each block (or module) can be put in or taken out from a bigger project. Each module has its own separate function that is interchangeable with other modules.

* __Process Isolation__: A process is when a program is run. By keeping processes separated, it prevents the failure of one process from causing another to fail. Virtual machines and containers isolate processes running inside them from those running elsewhere on a computer. This allows users to do many dangerous tasks (such as malware analysis) with little or no risk of harm outside of the virtual machine.

* __Resource Encapsulation__: Encapsulation is an object oriented concept where all data and functions required to use the resource are packaged into a single self-contained component. The goal is to only allow access or manipulation of the resource in the way the designer intended. An example, assume a flag pole is the object. There are fixed methods on how the flag pole is to be used. Put the flag on, take the flag off, raise or lower the flag. Nothing else can be done to the flag pole.

* __Simplicity__: Simplicity allows a person to better understand hardware and software. Without the clutter of unnecessarily complicated code and interfaces, the software will be more understandable by people that will update the code when requirements change. It will be easier to understand by the testers and they will be able to spot problems sooner. By keeping software as simple and as focused as possible, the reliability and security is greatly increased.
