# Lesson Plan: Hands-on IoT with - Littlebits Intro

### Summary
This lesson has two primary focuses: 1) Introducing GPIO, modularity, and component-based architectures as enabling features for invention and design and 2) Introducing [Littlebits](http://littlebits.cc/) as a plug-and-play building technology. The lesson will explore how to plug and play bits together to make simple (offline) apps.
